# Identification-Hotel-Reviews
Implemented a Naïve Bayes classifier and perception classifiers (including vanilla and averaged) to identify hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive, and either positive or negative. The word tokens were used as features to classification. The model was trained on the full training data. The F1 score of the Naïve Bayes model is over 0.86; that of perceptron classifiers can be more than 0.90.
